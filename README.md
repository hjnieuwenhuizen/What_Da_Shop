### AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) Pattern

The AAA pattern, also known as Arrange, Act, Assert, is a structured approach to writing unit tests. It helps maintain clarity and readability by dividing each test case into three distinct stages:

1. **Arrange**: Set up the preconditions and inputs for the test. This involves creating objects, initializing variables, and preparing the environment.

2. **Act**: Perform the actual action or behavior that you're testing. This could involve calling a function, executing a method, or interacting with the system under test.

3. **Assert**: Verify that the behavior of the system under test matches your expectations. Check the output, state changes, or any relevant outcomes to ensure that the system behaves as intended.

By following the AAA pattern, tests become more understandable, maintainable, and easier to debug. Each stage serves a clear purpose, making it evident what the test is doing and what it's verifying.
